-- In this assignment, your task is to create a postfix calculator, that implements all of the operations described below. In a postfix calculator, expressions are written using postfix notation, i.e. the operator comes after the operands.

-- For example, the postfix expression 2 3 + evaluates to 5, i.e. the same thing as 2 + 3. The infix expression 1/2 + 1/3 would be written 1 2 / 1 3 / + in postfix.

-- Postfix expressions don't use brackets, and don't use any operator precedence rules. For example, the infix expression 3 * (5 - 2) would be written 5 2 - 3 * in postfix.

-- For this assignment, we define tokens as follows:
-- Numbers. These are Haskell Double values.
-- Operators. An operator is a function that does something to the stack. All the operators are defined below. The name of an operator is a string consisting of 1, or more, characters, that doesnâ€™t start with a number, and contains no spaces.
